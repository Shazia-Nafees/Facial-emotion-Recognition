In this project, I developed a Facial Emotion Recognition system that detects and classifies emotions based on facial expressions in images or real-time video streams. The goal was to enable applications such as sentiment analysis, mental health monitoring, and human-computer interaction.
Applications
Healthcare: Monitoring patients' emotional states.
Education: Analyzing student engagement in online learning.
Customer Experience: Gauging customer satisfaction during interactions.
